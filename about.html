      <h2>Mia</h2>
      <p>
        Mia is currently a second-year student at Barnard College. Her grandma,
        featured in this comic, has been a collector of <i>Archie</i> comics for
        half a centuryâ€”and has gifted hundreds of <i>Archie</i> comics to Mia
        over the years, giving her a foundational understanding of comics as a
        literary language of its own. Mia also credits her father with providing
        her a love of language, reading to her often during her childhood and
        making trips to Barnes and Noble a favorite pastime.
